## Building or improving your own local community

Investing your time in developing a community of practice around computational
skills is an activity that can help you and others to develop research tools and
skills. Because of the rapid pace of innovation and development in computational
tools, getting started with digital tools can seem overwhelming, daunting, and
challenging. At the same time, the rate at which we can collect research data
sets is speeding up. The rate at which data is accumulating far surpasses many
of the mental models we currently have for how we work with data. The role of
community in developing skills and infrastructure is incredibly important - 'It
takes a village' ... - and the ability of groups of people sharing ideas and
tools with each other can accelerate and improve capabilities and research
outcomes for your lab, your department and your organization.

The Carpentries have found that developing local communities takes intentional
and committed boots-on-the-ground community champions who are energetic,
innovative, and excited about supporting and growing their community. Over the
past few years, we as a broader global community have gathered together the
lessons learned and shared across the world. Now we're sharing them with you
through this cookbook. We hope that you can learn from, be inspired by, and
contribute back to this cookbook all the 'recipes' and ideas you've tried. Join
our [quarterly meetings](https://pad.carpentries.org/champions) and get support
from our global community, or give support to others who are just getting
started.

## What is a community of practice?

A community of practice is simply a group of people who share a particular craft
or shared purpose. In the case of Carpentries communities, these tend to be
communities that apply computational skills toward research challenges. How
exactly this might look at your organization or institution is up to you. Some
communities support bioinformaticians in their efforts to wrangle and improve
bioinformatics workflows. Others cast wide nets with terms like "Digital
Scholarship" to invite and include those from all disciplines and backgrounds,
urging them to come together for support around computational skills. Still
others run small, highly focused study groups or book clubs on niche topics,
working to support each other as they practice and develop new skills. How or
what you develop is up to you: you'll probably find that you already participate
in some communities of practice. Whether it is your lab group, the team you work
for, or a cross-institutional collaboration you're a part of, these are all
communities of practice. This guide will give you some ideas and tips for how to
build and interconnect these existing communities, or build new ones that have
shared goals and purpose.

## Contributing

We invite you to contribute to this guide. Our plan is for it to be a living and
growing document of curated ideas. In this 'cookbook', we look to gather from
our global community the practices used to initiate and cultivate these
communities. If you have a particular practice that has worked for you, we
invite you to share it with our community. Please open an
[issue](https://github.com/carpentries/community-cookbook/issues) in the GitHub
repository which generates this guide, and share a link, resource, or
testimonial with us. If you're familiar with Git, create a [pull
request](https://github.com/carpentries/community-cookbook/pulls) with a
suggested addition and our cookbook maintainers will work with you to integrate
your contribution.

## Codes of Conduct

The Carpentries community strongly encourages a Code of Conduct (CoC) being in
place at all gathering places, whether online and offline. CoCs support open and
collaborative environments and ensure there are stated rules for appropriate and
inappropriate behavior. We encourage you to adopt/develop a CoC for any
activities you plan and to notify your attendees/participants of the text and
what they are expected to abide by. There are many great CoCs out there, and it
is really up to you to select one that you feel fits the needs of your
activities and community. For certain events, such as Carpentries workshops, you
will be required to adopt [the Carpentries
CoC](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
to run the event under their name. Codes of Conduct are important documents for
ensuring the openness and inclusivity of your community.

You are welcome to use our Code of Conduct as the basis for your own.
