# Support Structures

There are many ways to build long-term support for your community of practice into the social fabric of your institution. When the story gets around your campus or organization that there is a community that can help with computational skills, you may be asked how you can support more people. To do so may present an opportunity to translate your community from an informal collection of colleagues into a more formalized support structure at your organization. This chapter lays out stories and ideas about how to approach, or even create various support structures within your organization that can continue to support these efforts.

### Collecting evidence

To win funding support, evidence of efficacy is generally required. For every Hacky Hour attendee, the [UQ Hacky Hour team](https://hackyhourstluc.wordpress.com/) note the name, school or institute, problem to be solved, and whether this was an attendee's first visit or if it was a repeat visit. (People often come week after week until they reach a final resolution of a problem.) Details of helpers are noted as well. This information is then reorded in a spreadhsheet so that the scope of advice sought and the help provided can easily be demonstrated as evidence that a need for this kind of advice and support exists. The growing numbers demonstrate that the service will soon be overwhelmed by the demand, and that more formal support is required.

# Funding Workshops

There are several potential sources of funding available for workshops, whether these be at an institution, or run as some kind of
event tie-in, say, at a conference within a specific discipline.

## Where to start with your own institution

There are several potential sources of workshop funding within your own institution:

- individual schools, departments, or research centers, especially within those disciplines where computational and data skills are 
needed, but are currently lacking, e.g. in humanities, linguistics, social sciences
- research committees
- research-related units, e.g. research office, graduate schools, postgraduate student recruitment, as they may be interested in supporting training
- student associations, e.g. postgraduate student societies or discipline-specific student associations, e.g. [COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/)
- computing societies of all kinds on campus
- e-research computing or digital scholarship units, if they exist at your institution
- libraries

All of the above may be willing to provide funding for a first workshop if you make a good case for it. Use some of the materials in
[this repository](https://github.com/carpentries/commons) to make your case.

## Outside your institution

1. Conferences may be good places to try to obtain funding for a workshop. The conference organisers may be willing to manage
logistics for the workshop, such as finding a venue, sourcing instructors, and handling registration in return for a workshop
sign-up fee that goes to them.

2. Industry is another source of funding. Companies such as Amazon and Microsoft may be willing to fund a workshop as that may drive customers
to their cloud solutions. If you are running a workshop targeted at a specific discipline, then try to find a local industry partner
who might be willing to put up a little money to fund it as long as they can display their logo or banner at the event and on
any advertising, or address the assembled workshop participants either within the workshop or over a sponsored lunch or coffee break.

3. National infrastructure related to e-research support or supercomputing might also be useful places to try.

## Can you run a workshop *without* funding?

You can! The simplest way to do that is to charge a fee to attendees to cver the costs of organising the workshop. This need not be much but
charging has several benefits:

- people who register for a fee are more likely to attend and stay for the whole workshop
- fees may allow you to provide catering which is always popular and helps with keeping people at the workshop
- registration fees allow you to cover any costs incurred, such as room hire, instructor travel, the
purchase of workshop necessities such as sticky notes,
whiteboard markers, extension cables and power boards (and possibly wifi/wifi boosters)
- any money not spent can be saved to help fund later workshops

If you can find a suitable room on campus that can seat 20 or more people at tables, that has good wifi, and is accessible, then
you can run your workshop for little to no money at all.

This [post from the Software Carpentry blog](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/04/workshops-limited-budget.html) lists a few strategies for running workshops with limited or no funding.

# How to Scale up The Carpentries

In October of 2018, community member Lex Nederbragt brought forward a discussion happening at his home institution (University of Oslo) about how to scale up Carpentry teaching to have more impact on campus. Lex posed a series of questions to the community and a rich discussion was had, summarized below.

Making our workshops into required courses may change (reduce) the motivation for learners and instructors.

>*  Have other universities made the same move, or are they planning this, and if so, how are they organizing this effort?
>* How to keep learners motivated if they feel they are required to take a Carpentries workshops?
>* How to keep the quality of instruction, and instructor motivation, high, if workshops become organized like regular courses?


## Discussion overview 

[Giacomo Peru](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M7129de063f2d223de11c9f15/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) points out that to be succesful The Carpentries need not run afoul of existing strucutures. They need to find ways to be harmoniously in existence within the ecosystem in which they operate. 


[Stephanie Labou](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M2ebe0f78acab0ce249fc18f2/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) writes that the Unviersity of California Sand Diego is considering workshops for inclusion in a co-curricular record (CCR), a detailed enumeration of the professional development activities someone has undertaken outside of formal curricula without associated red-tape around assigning credit.


[Peter Hoyt](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-Mf583f6c2e939923bcb68b4b3/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) acknowledges that Universities would like to be in the value stream of skills training and thus charge for workshops and the learning taking place at them. Peter suggests, moving to a flipped model with more teaching done online.


[April Wright](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M0223a648d868c59f6cfeea05/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) suggest having different sections and thus expecations as part of the same course. Combining lecture and hands on activities, but expecting more of those who take the course and expect credit. April also talks about instructor motivation and some ways to keep the instructor expeirence fresh for instructors.

[Simon Waldman](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M1f39cde2b163166912413882/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) notes that as workshops scale up, that it might be necessary to make workshop instruction part of people's paid jobs. 

[Sarah Brown](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-Ma36b00d5ab62bada8cc4d068/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) mentioned how Mathworks (makers of MATLAB) would fund a TA position for an expert in MATLAB in courses requiring MATLAB.

[Hao Ye](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M7046a25f5d342a2837f478bc/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) points out that much of relevant R and Python training is taught by adjuncts and full-time faculty seldom teach these kinds of workshops. To value these skills, Hao suggests that faculty teach these skills more. 

[David Bapst](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M7c543979d513a32bf16fe69e/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) points out that short-form workshops and long-form semester type courses feed different niches and there is a place for both of them in the institution. David warns against thinking of one or the other, and thinking about ways both structures can thrive and feed into each other.

[Sebastian Schmeier](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tad9e416c2ec4742e-M55f7c513037d656998cda099/how-can-we-scale-up-carpentries-training-at-universities) talks about how the support structures inside semester courses are sometimes not as condicive to using Carpentry teaching practices. Sebastian addressed this by spreading the load and asking more senior students to come in 1-2 times per semester to help out. This worked, but the culture at Massey is such that this could only be supported for so long. 

## Scaling Up Summary and Considerations

It is clear from the communnity feedback that there is a place for short-form workshops and short-form workshops afford certain leeways and teaching practices that aren't neceessarily able to be duplicated in semester courses. It is also clear that attendence to these workshops as a demonstration of a researcher's continuing education and professional development are seen as important. As you seek to navigate your own institutions or network of instututions, this thread provides a rich trove of areas to consider as you bring forth a program that works well for your community. 

* Short form [workshops are different](http://carpentries.org/workshops) in content and pedagogy than most semester courses.
* 2-days or less is an important length of time to both be impactful, but not overwhelming
* Reflecting Carpentry teaching practices into semester courses is a good thing, and is a sign of maturity in your community.
* Having instructors share common teaching materials (our community lessons) is an important distinction of workshop teaching.
* Finding ways for learners and instructors to receive credit for their participation in workshops is important.
* Searching for and finding a niche for Carpentry workshops that is productive and helpful to your community needs to be done in a considered and careful manner.
